/**
 * This function will query the CS4640 server for a new set of categories.
 *
 * It makes use of AJAX and Promises to await the result.  We won't discuss
 * promises in detail, so you're welcome to review this code for more
 * details.  However, essentially we need the browser to send an AJAX query
 * to our API and then wait for a reply.  If it just waits, then the browser
 * tab will appear to be frozen briefly while the HTTP request is taking place.
 * Therefore, we send the request with a Promise that awaits the results.  When
 * the response comes back from the server, the promise will return the result
 * to our getRandomCategories() function and that will call your function.  This happens
 * asynchronously, so you should treat your function like you would an event
 * handler.

/**

 * parameter (the new categories provided by the server) and handle the
 * setup of your new game.  For example, if you write a function 
 * named "setUpNewGame(newCategories)", then in your event handler for a new
 * game, you should call this function as:
 *     getRandomCategories(setUpNewGame);
 * Our getRandomCategories function will wait for the server to provide 
 * a new set of categories, and then it will call **your** function, passing in 
 * the categories as an object, so that your function can continue setting up 
 * the new game.
